## Current astrophotography gear

My current gear used for the astro photography sessions is somehow considered as an entry level, based on cost and complexity of other more experienced colleagues that in the business.

### Mount Bresser EXOS-2 EQ GoTo

I am running my gear on a [Bresser EXOS-2 EQ GoTo](https://www.bresser.de/en/Astronomy/BRESSER-Messier-EXOS-2-EQ-GoTo-Mount.html) which I purchased initially to use it with a Newtonian Bresser telescope. There are a couple of minuses this mount has like lack of computerised connectivity with the acquisition software and backlash (which I believe every mount has until you solve it).

I like the go-to system which helps me to quickly navigate to my targets. Even with the perfect polar alignment and the 1-3 stars alignment sometimes I still don't get the target in my scope sight and I need to manually adjust the mount's position.


### Telescope William Optics GT71

The [William Optics Gran Turismo GT 71](https://williamoptics.com/all-new-gran-turismo-71-apo-refractor) is an apochromatic refractor with an `aperture` (the diameter of the objective lens or the mirror) of 71mm and `focal length` (the distance between the objective lens or mirror and the focal point) of 420mm.

This is a very good telescope built with three pieces of FPL-53 glass which makes the 3 colours (red, green and blue) to align perfectly at the focal point. Really love this piece.

### Camera Canon EOS 750D

I acquired the [Canon EOS 750D](https://www.canon-europe.com/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_750d/) second hand especially for the astrophotography sessions. For a non-dedicated, un-modified DSLR camera the results are very good. I've been using the camera at -5° Celsius all night without any problems. Sturdy built camera good for an entry level hobby.


### Guiding Camera

ASI 120mm + guide scopes


### Additional gear

To a minimum this is all you need: telescope, camera and a mount. However, in case you want ease up your work and to have images to high exposure, I find it best to actually use the following items.

#### Flattener William Optics

I acquired the [William Optics Adjustable Flattener Reducer Flat6AIII](https://williamoptics.com/2019-all-new-adjustable-flat6aiii-t-mount-not-included) together with the William Optics telescope. With this flattener the William Optics GT71 telescope will have a `focal length` of 336mm which gets me a wider field of view at a faster exposure time too. The purpose of this piece is to flatten the image at the corners where you would normally get some coma like visual aberrations.

#### Polar Allign



#### Image Acquisition Hardware


#### Image Acquisition Software

#### Dew heaters

With Gem-based themes, directories such as the `assets`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. This allows for easier installation and updating as you don't have to manage any of the theme files.
