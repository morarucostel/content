The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy with diameter of about 220,000 light years, approximately 2.5 million light-years from Earth and the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way.

It was the very first target I shot with my new William Optics GT71 telescope. After months of waiting for the telescope to arrive and then for the weather to clear up, I just had to take advantage of two nights with clear sky, even if the Moon was > 86% illumination.

Being the first deep sky object with a new telescope, I spent a lot of time under the night sky, playing with the focuser and the Bahtinov mask, enjoying the new `toy` and playing with the ZWO ASI 120mm camera used for tracking. From my experience, introducing a new object or change in your astro-photography shooting session will require a learning curve, no matter how much research you do before the shooting session. First night out with my new William Optics GT71 was a great success considering the Moon illumination and the limited amount of time I had for shooting the target.

The brightness of the nightly sky can be seen in the first two single shots presented in the gallery, followed by the final processed image.
