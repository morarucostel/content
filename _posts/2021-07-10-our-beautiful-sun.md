It was a sunny day, at home with my children when I realised that is a very good opportunity to show them the Sun through my Newtonian telescope. So, I brought outside my gear: the [BRESSER NT-203/1000](https://www.bresser.de/en/Astronomy/Telescopes/BRESSER-Messier-NT-203-1000-Hexafoc-EXOS-2-EQ5-Telescope.html) telescope with its mount and the solar filter.

**Extremely important:** Do not look directly into the Sun with a telescope without a proper solar filter on the FRONT end of the telescope.

It took me 10 minutes to set everything up and we started looking at the Sun amazed by its perfect white and roundness. To me it looked like the whitest white and the roundness round I have ever seen.

I used multiple Barlow lenses 2x and 3x together with the 26 mm Super Pl√∂ssl eyepiece. It allowed me to zoom in quite a lot and it was outstanding to see the perfect edge of the Sun. Unfortunately there is nothing to distinguish on the Sun surface and I wasn't able to notice any Sun spots or flares but it still was an awesome view. The kids were extremely happy to see the Sun through the telescope and in no time we had to create the queue line with 30 seconds of viewing per person.

I brought out the Canon EOS 750D camera and then connected it, via a T2 adapter, to the telescope. I can only say that these pictures don't do justice to the real image seen through the telescope. I will leave you with these images which I took that beautiful day.
